Husband and father living in the middle of Michigan, US. I've been talking to computers for as long as I can remember (my first rig was the Commodore 64). I enjoy playing all sorts of games: board, card, video. My idea of a good weekend consists of hanging out with family, cooking lots of food, and taking lots of naps. I need coffee, every single day. My two boys have taught me more about Minecraft and Roblox than I would have ever have liked to have known in this lifetime. I enjoy watching documentaries, hacking around with new stuff in my home lab, and playing chess (five minute blitz is probably my favorite). I'm on the fence about the Oxford comma.

I'm regularly finding myself working towards minimalism, in particular, when it comes to tooling.
It's very normal to have many hundreds of secrets to use and manage on a regular basis.
Arguably, the best tool we have for the job right now are commonly referred to as "password managers".
There are lots of them out there: [LastPass](https://mamercad.github.io), [1Password](https://1password.com), [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org), and more.
Right now, for better or worse, I use LastPass.

Should you find yourself in tech, you can probably triple the number of secrets you'll need to regularly manage.
And no, I'm not saying that a person should store their _work_ secrets in their _personal_ password manager -- unless the secret in question is in fact personal, e.g., your work SSH key pair.
An example of what *not* to store in your personal vault, as far as work is concerned, would be a shared `root` password (those should only live in whatever vault your workplace provides).

Since I'm already using a password manager for secrets, it seems natural to store my SSH key pair there as well (back to that minimalism thing).
This probably isn't a new idea, but, I'll show you how I happen to do it so that it's a bit less cumbersome.
As I've mentioned, I use LastPass.
In particular, for this stuff, we'll need the CLI version which you can find [here](https://github.com/lastpass/lastpass-cli).
With Homebrew, it's as easy as `brew install lastpass-cli`.
For completeness, I'll generate a new key pair, so we can do the whole process, end-to-end.

### Generate an SSH key pair (optional)

```bash
‚ùØ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "Demo/ssh" -N "hunter2" -f demo.key
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Your identification has been saved in demo.key.
Your public key has been saved in demo.key.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:A04anciW2RmsQ/okvKfkiWyGAe20LBYJ7exPbCATZCs Demo/ssh
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 4096]----+
|.+   ..          |
|+ o..*.+         |
|EB.oB.B          |
|=oX.+= .         |
|.B.O... S        |
|o.B *    .       |
|+* B             |
|o++ .            |
|o                |
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

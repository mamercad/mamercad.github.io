Took me a while to figure out SSH keys (with passphrases) in CI.
I do much of my work (in operations) with [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible).
Typically, secrets in CI are handled with environment variables.
Suppose you need to SSH from within CI to do some work; the following should do the trick (in a Linux or Linux-like runtime):

```bash
eval $(ssh-agent)
install -b -m 600 /dev/null ssh.key
echo "${SSH_PRIVATE_KEY}" >ssh.key
echo "${SSH_PASSPHRASE}" \
  | SSH_ASKPASS=cat setsid -c ssh-add ssh.key
ssh-add -l
```

Hopefully your CI will redact the secrets.
As you can see, you'll need `ssh-agent`, `install`, `cat`, `setsid`, and, `ssh-add`.
As far as the secrets go, your private key should be stored in the environment as `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` and the passphrase as `SSH_PASSPHRASE`.

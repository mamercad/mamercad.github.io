Just documenting current password strategy.
Phasing out LastPass in favor of 1Password (I've already import into 1Password, but haven't pulled the "delete" trigger yet).
Both are set up with MFA at Authy (with cloud backup and password) and a YubiKey; kind of nice that they have a desktop application.
Try and keep Authy as only a "top-level" 2FA, and put the rest of the 2FAs into 1Password.
Authy is tied to a phone number, so, have to hang on to that.
It'd be nice if multiple physical tokens could be added to 1Password (to physically vault one).

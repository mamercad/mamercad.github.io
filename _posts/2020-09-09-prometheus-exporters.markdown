Just dropping a quick entry here to make mention of a couple of [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) exporters I've hacked together recently. Firstly, there's a [Speedtest](https://speedtest.net) exporter [here](https://github.com/mamercad/speedtest-exporter). Next, there's a [Ambient Weather](https://ambientweather.net) exporter [here](https://github.com/mamercad/ambientweather-exporter). They should both have enough in the `README.md` to get going. If not, raise an issue please.

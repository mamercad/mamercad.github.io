<h3 id="profile">Profile</h3>

<p>I am an experienced system engineer that&#8217;s been working in technology for over 20 years.
I love designing greenfield environments, but don’t mind unwinding and refactoring brownfield ones.
I approach the management of systems from the perspective of a developer.
I thoroughly enjoy implementing automation and monitoring.
I have plenty of real-world experience in datacenter and cloud operations, virtualization, operating systems, databases, development and system integration.
I learn quickly and have very strong analytics problem-solving skills.
I can work on a team but am most productive when given tough problems to solve and the creative freedom to implement them.
I firmly believe in open-source software and giving back.
I am always looking out for creative challenges and complicated systems problems to tackle.
As it pertains to education, I plan on pursuing a PhD when my youngest child enters school (a few years out).
I have set up and maintained, typically from scratch, numerous mission critical multi-tier systems.
In most of my positions, I typically maintain a large role, generally working from the metal all the way to application.
As of late, I spend most of mime working towards “infrastructure from code” and automation in general.
I want to continue evolving as a systems engineer and a developer.
I am comfortable and experienced in developing the full stack.
In order to be happy, I need an unrestricted Macbook, the freedom to use (and to contribute back) to the open source community, and the ability to work remotely from time to time.</p>
